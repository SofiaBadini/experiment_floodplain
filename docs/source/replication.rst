.. _replication:


**********************
Replication of results
**********************

This project will output a .pdf document named ``paper_results_replication.pdf``
(under *bld/latex*, a copy is in the root folder), which contains all tables
and figures in the paper **as long as the files** ``original_survey_data.csv``
**and** ``rvo_pc6.csv`` **are placed under** *src/experiment_floodplain/data*.
Otherwise, the project will use synthetic data (thus merely showing that the code
works).
